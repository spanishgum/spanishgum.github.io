I really enjoy data visualization because it is a task with a clear end game with room for customization and tweaks. The result can be something artistic and beautiful.

I started browsing around <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/browse?sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93">NASAs Open Data Portal</a> and ordered it by most accessed. I tried looking through by recently added but honestly much of their data revolves around topics outside my realm of knowledge. It is easier to find a domain to work with by searching for things most people like.

The top data set as of this post is meteorite landings. I grabbed a link to the csv, opened up a python shell, and checked it out.

```python
>>> import requests

>>> link = 'https://data.nasa.gov/api/views/gh4g-9sfh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD'
>>> with open('met.csv', 'w') as out:
...    out.write(requests.get(link).content.decode('utf-8'))
```

BOOM, we have our dataset.

To be continued...
