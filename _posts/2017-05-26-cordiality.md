Opening yourself up can be very rewarding. I've always felt that an unwillingness to engage with different people and the complacency of accompnying oneself with only like minded peers can stagnate personal growth. In this life we are all adventurers, searching for purpose or wandering with the wind. We started on unique paths with a vision beyond the horizon. Sometimes these paths and visions don't quite align, but it is a wonderful thing to share them with each other and discover new perspectives that might not be found elsewhere.

So before you are quick to judge the next person you meet that seems.. off.. remember that they are experiencing their own journey with a different set of challenges, goals, and starting cards. Don't be afraid to give your attention to someone outside your realm of normality, and be cordial. Kindness has a funny way of being reflective.
