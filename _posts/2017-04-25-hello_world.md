Hello, World. My name is Adam. I am about to graduate with my masters in computer science. Life is about to get very exciting! The world is feeling smaller and smaller the older I get. The idea of traveling to China to test my Mandarin seems realistic. The doors that have opened up for me in the last two years of living are more than I have ever dreamed of. I grew up in lower middle class America, and perfectly happy with it. My community was pleasant; I was surrounded by wonderful people who encouraged me and told me I would go far. Life has treated me well. Before I go off ranting about my childhood, putting you to sleep, I would like to say thanks to everyone who has gotten me where I am today. Every person I have interacted with has made an impact on me, and led me up to this moment. For that, I am thankful.

So hello, world! Welcome to my blog! :D
