Hello, World! My name is Adam. I am about to graduate with my masters in computer science and life is about to get very exciting! I am finally getting the hang of this jekyll tool and I want to commit myself to writing short blog posts in the future as I take on new challenges in the field. I have a lot to learn and may be a noobie, but I am very passionate about my career. Here's to a new beginning!

Cheers.
