Today I was reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14210032">a post</a> regarding China-Europe space collaboration. I started reading about the Chinese space programs, and uncovered that China is banned from the ISS. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wolf_(politician)">Frank Wolf</a>, a former legislator, encouraged congress to enact laws in place to disallow collaboration of NASA with Chinese space programs.

The official legislation can be found <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ55/html/PLAW-112publ55.htm">here</a>.

I find it baffling that science is stonewalled simply because of fear of supporting the advancement of another country's technology, and potential espionage.

The Chinese space program seems to be growing from what I see in the media. I believe collaboration could strengthen ties, and advance international space research for the benefit of society.

I am not a very politically oriented person, but I believe in the collective pursuit of knowledge. The world is getting too small for countries to close each other off in the name of national security. I believe international security is a greater goal, achievable by researching technology that can provide for future generations to come.

Cheers.
