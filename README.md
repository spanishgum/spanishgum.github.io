# spanishgum

Welcome to [my github page](http://spanishgum.github.io/)!

Here I have used jekyll, and the hacker theme from github. The generic theme is shown [here](http://pages-themes.github.io/hacker). You can find the more themes over [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/).

The purpose of this page is to show the world who I am, keep a record of my thoughts in a blog, and occasionally write technical reports on cool stuff I am doing.

Feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:spanishgum@gmail.com) if you have questions!
