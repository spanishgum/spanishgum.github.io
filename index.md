Hi, I'm Adam! I like computer sciences, mathematics, music, food, and good people.
I am a research assistant at [COAPS-FSU](http://coaps.fsu.edu/).

## Where do I see myself?

I am interested in machine learning applications, data science, distributed systems, and quantam computing. I am seeking a company that can foster my growth in these areas. You can contact me at [aps10d@my.fsu.edu](mailto:aps10d@my.fsu.edu).
